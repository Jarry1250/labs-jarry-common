			<p>Welcome to my index of Wikimedia Labs tools I (User:Jarry1250) have been involved in the development of. If you have any queries, you can always contact me by leaving a message on <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Jarry1250">my en.wp talk page</a> or by following that page's "Email this user" link on the lest hand side. <em>Note that tools may be periodically removed. If you rely on one that does get removed, just tell me and I will replace it for you.</em> The last such rotation was in February 2019, during the transition to Debian.</p>
